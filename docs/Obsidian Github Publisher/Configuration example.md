1. Folder reception settings : 
    - Reception settings : `YAML frontmatter`
    - Default folder : `docs/notes`
    - Choose your frontmatter key, same as in `configuration.yml`, by default: `category`
    - Root folder : `docs`
2. Workflow
    - Leave blank the GitHub actions
    - Auto-clean up : `TRUE`
    - Excluded folder : `docs/assets/logo, docs/assets/js, docs/assets/css`[^3]
2. Images settings : 
    - Turn on transfer image
    - Choose `docs/assets/img`
3. Folder note : `True`

The files (and the image) will be sent on your GitHub repository template, in the specified folder. The conversion will be done by the [github actions](https://github.com/Mara-Li/obsidian-mkdocs-publisher-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) when the branch were merged.

#### Limitations
- No plugins (dataview...)
- No graph view
- You need to have a clean tree structure with unique name file. No worry about the display in blog ; the `title` key in frontmatter will change it, so you can have a `ezarezozre` name and use a good title like `reading book`. 
-  I prefer to encourage you to use the `shortlinks` option in obsidian’s link option. 
- Obs2mk will don’t move the file if you change the `category` value : you need to manually delete it to prevent duplicate.
