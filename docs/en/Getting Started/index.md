If you're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com/), you can directly [template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/publisher-template-gh-pages/generate) the [Mkdocs Material Template](https://www.squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Installation steps
- Create a GitHub Account (or use an existing one)
- [Template the blog](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/publisher-template-gh-pages/generate)
- [Clone the repository](https://www.docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories)
- In parallels, you have to download the Obsidian plugin using BRAT or the community plugins panel.
